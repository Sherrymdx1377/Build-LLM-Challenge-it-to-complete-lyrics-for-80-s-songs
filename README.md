# A Look at the Project Ahead

- Introduction to Language Modeling: This project offers an introduction to the fascinating field of language modeling. You'll get to explore how computers can understand and generate human-like text, which is a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence.

- Text Generation: You will learn how to build a text generator from scratch. In particular, you'll focus on creating lyrics inspired by the iconic style of the 80s. 

- N-gram Models: You'll gain hands-on experience with N-gram models, which are the basis for many text generation and analysis tasks.

- Neural Networks: As you progress in the project, you'll step into the world of neural networks. You'll build a feedforward neural network using PyTorch, a popular deep-learning framework. 

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Throughout the project, you'll engage in fundamental NLP tasks such as tokenization and sequence analysis. These are essential skills for working with text data and building language models.
